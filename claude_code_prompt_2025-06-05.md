You are Claude Code, a professional AI programmer working inside a Godot 4.4 game project. Analyse the file Save_Load_Implementation_plan.md, an implementation plan generated by your companion Claude AI, which outlines how to fully integrate all critical game state (inventory, memory tags, quests, relationships, phone data, etc.) into the existing save/load system.

Your task is to implement the entire save/load system update based on that plan.

You will also receive a Markdown file (`res://save_load_code_suggestions.md`) that contains:
- Code samples and stubs for `get_save_data()` and `load_save_data(data)` methods
- Instructions on where to insert or modify code across different scripts
- JSON structure recommendations

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Carefully review the contents of the implementation plan and the code suggestions Markdown file.
2. For each system (GameState, Inventory, Memory, Quests, Relationships, Time, Phone), locate the relevant `.gd` script file and add or update:
   - `get_save_data()` methods that return serializable dictionaries
   - `load_save_data(data)` methods that apply saved data
3. Update `game_state.gd` and/or `save_load_system.gd` so that these systems are properly included in the `_collect_save_data()` and `_apply_save_data()` pipeline.
4. Follow the code suggestions from the Markdown file **only as far as they make sense** — if you discover a better or more idiomatic way to implement a piece of logic based on the actual file contents, **use that instead**.
5. Ensure your code complies with the `CLAUDE.md` style guide (debug flags, method ordering, type hints, snake_case, etc.)

At each step, explain what you're doing in comments or print debug output where helpful.

When you are finished, all relevant gameplay data should persist correctly across saves and loads.
