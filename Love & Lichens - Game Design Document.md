## **Vision Statement**

Love & Lichens is a whimsical RPG set in a college of environmental science that combines relationship-building, environmental education, sometimes engaging in theatrical "combat" through debates (in addition to a nonlethal, whimsical standard combat system). Players will explore a magical-realist version of campus life, building connections with fellow students and faculty while uncovering the secrets of ecological systems through both scientific study and magical abilities gained through understanding nature more deeply.

## **Core Game Concept**

The player takes on the role of a new student at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. As they progress through their studies, they'll develop relationships with colorful characters, engage in environmental debates, and gradually unlock magical abilities tied to their growing understanding of nature's interconnectedness.

The game balances educational content about environmental science with whimsical magical realism, creating an experience that's both informative and enchanting. The core gameplay loop revolves around attending classes, completing quests, building relationships, and using both scientific knowledge and magical powers to solve environmental mysteries on campus.

## **Gameplay Systems**

### **Relationship System**

Players build connections with NPCs through dialogue, quests, and shared experiences. Relationships progress through several stages:

* Stranger  
* Acquaintance  
* Friend  
* Close Friend  
* Romantic Interest (for some characters)

Each NPC has unique interests, dislikes, and theatrical abilities they can teach the player. Building stronger relationships unlocks new quests, abilities, and dialogue options.

### **Environmental Debate System**

Rather than traditional combat, some encounters are resolved through "debates" where the player uses different rhetorical techniques:

**Standard Debate Moves:**

* Logical Argument  
* Passionate Appeal  
* Scientific Evidence  
* Personal Anecdote  
* Compromise Proposal

**Theatrical Special Moves (unlocked through relationships):**

* Dramatic Monologue  
* Interpretive Dance  
* Lichen Facts  
* Ethical Argument

The debate system uses "resolve" instead of health points. Different opponents are weak or strong against different approaches, encouraging players to develop diverse rhetorical skills.

### **Magic & Environmental Powers**

As players deepen their connection with nature, they unlock magical abilities:

* Lichen Whisper: Communicate with lichen to gain ecological insights  
* Mycelial Network: Connect to fungal information networks to locate objects or NPCs  
* Photosynthesis Burst: Channel the power of sunlight to heal or energize  
* Ecological Projection: Visualize past or future ecological states of an area

These powers are used to solve puzzles, access hidden areas, and gain unique insights into campus mysteries.

### **Quest System**

Quests range from academic assignments to environmental mysteries:

* Research projects requiring specimen collection and analysis  
* Environmental investigations (like the "Water Quality Crisis")  
* Relationship-building quests  
* Special quests to learn theatrical abilities

Quest rewards include items, relationship improvements, and skill increases.

### **Nemesis System**

Some debate opponents can become recurring antagonists if defeated, with escalating confrontations. Players can choose to reconcile with nemeses or continue rivalries, affecting campus politics and personal relationships.

## **Story & Setting**

### **Setting**

A magical-realist version of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, where natural processes have subtle magical expressions visible to those who understand them deeply. Campus locations include:

### **Main Story Arc**

The main storyline involves a mysterious ecological imbalance affecting the campus and surrounding areas. As the player progresses through their studies and builds relationships, they gradually uncover the underlying causes and potential solutions, culminating in a final confrontation that tests all their scientific knowledge, relationship skills, and magical abilities.

## **Conclusion**

Love & Lichens aims to create a unique blend of relationship building, environmental education, and magical realism within a small but richly detailed campus setting. By focusing on character interactions, educational content, and a novel "debate" system rather than traditional combat, the game offers a fresh take on RPG mechanics while remaining feasible for solo development.

The project's scope is deliberately contained to enable completion within the six-month timeline while still delivering a meaningful and engaging experience that celebrates the wonder of environmental science through both factual content and magical storytelling.
