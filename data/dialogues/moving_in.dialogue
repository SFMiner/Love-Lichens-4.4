# Scene 1: Adam Arrives at the Dorm
# ------------------------

You shoulder open the door to your new dorm room.  
Someone’s already partly moved in.

Adam: [wait=0.3] Looks like I’m not first here. I guess that's about right, classes start tomorrow.

Narrator:  
You spot a food bowl by the window.  
A soft cat bed tucked against the wall.  
Toys scattered like breadcrumbs.

- Inspect the food bowl
	Adam: [examining] Fresh water. Not long ago.

- Look around more
	Adam: [observing] Cat toys, scratcher... Whoever it is, they travel smart.

- Start unpacking
	Adam: [muttering] Might as well claim a corner.

Narrator:  
Footsteps echo outside the door.

# -- COMMENT: After this =END, player can move freely. 
# Fate will arrive shortly (based on player action or light timer).

# ------------------------
# Scene 2: Meeting Fate
# ------------------------

Narrator:  
The door swings open.  
Someone steps in, balancing a box with one arm and a backpack with the other.

Fate: [cheerfully awkward] Hey! You must be Adam.

Adam: [smiling] That's me.  
Adam: [wait=0.2] Uh, hi.

- Shake hands
	Adam: Good to meet you.

- Smile shyly
	Adam: Hi.

- Make a joke
	Adam: Please tell me you’re not hiding snakes too.

Fate: [laughs] Nope. Just one feline overlord.

Fate: I'm Fate. I got here earlier.  
Fate: You probably noticed Socks’ stuff already.

Adam: Socks?

Fate: My cat. They're around. [wait=0.3] Shy, but curious.

Narrator:  
As you glance toward the bed, you catch a flicker — a tail, a flash of ears — before it vanishes under a dresser.

Fate: [smiling] They'll come out when they're ready.

[next=auto]

# -- COMMENT: After this =END, player gets first real free roam. 
# Adam can explore campus, unpack, nap. 
# Venom encounter triggers when player returns to room.

# ------------------------
# Scene 3: Meeting Venom (Poison)
# ------------------------

Narrator:  
You push the door open.  
Inside, the room has shifted again.

Narrator:  
Several tanks are stacked neatly along one wall.  
Soft cloth covers some of them.  
The air hums faintly.

Narrator:  
Someone sits at the desk, methodically adjusting a tank cover.

Poison: [without looking] Roommate?

Adam: [stepping inside] Yeah. Adam.

Poison: Venom.  
Poison: [short pause] Poison’s fine.

- Comment on the tanks
	Adam: [grinning] Impressive setup.

- Joke lightly
	Adam: Tell me none of those things are loose.

- Stay polite but neutral
	Adam: Looks like you moved in early.

Poison: [reacts depending on choice]
- If interested: [gruff] "Most people panic. You didn't."
- If joking: [smirk] "Only the best ones escape."
- If neutral: [nod] "Had stuff to set up."

[next=auto]

Narrator:  
At the edge of your vision —  
A twitch of black fur under Fate’s bed.

Fate: [offscreen laugh] Socks is scouting.

Adam: [amused] Tactical advantage.

Poison: [gruff but pleased] Field recon.

[next=auto]

=END

# -- COMMENT: After this =END, all three roommates have been introduced.
# Player can now free-roam, unpack more, start seeing random light roommate chatter.

# ------------------------
# Scene 4: Socks Makes His Move
# ------------------------

Narrator:  
The room buzzes softly with life — unpacking, murmured conversation, charger cables tangling.  
You’re midway through sorting your books when —

[wait=1.0]

Narrator:  
A sudden blur of black darts across the floor.

Poison: [startled grunt] Hey!

Narrator:  
Socks is gleefully attacking Poison’s shoelaces.  
Tugging. Biting. Purring loudly.

Fate: [grinning] You've been officially accepted.

- Joke about being next
	Adam: Better hide my sneakers.

- Tease Poison
	Adam: Socks has good taste.

- Laugh and stay quiet
	Adam: [chuckles quietly]

Poison: [depends on reaction]
- If joked: [deadpan] "Betrayed by footgear."
- If teased: [gruff grin] "You’re next, kid."
- If quiet: [nod of grudging respect]

Narrator:  
The tension in the room lifts — not all at once, but enough.  
Maybe... this could be home.

=END

# -- COMMENT: After this =END, player fully unlocked in the dorm space.
# All roommate relationships gently seeded.
# Future story events (bug hunt, movie night, study sessions) can now naturally trigger.
