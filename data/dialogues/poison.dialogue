Poison: No, but they'll be back. We have their cat! Somewhere...
Adam: Oh, yeah! I saw some cat things when I first got in.
Poison: But not the cat, huh? It's been hiding since Ive been here too. I guess they're a scaredy cat!

		Adam: OMG is your town's board of ed some kind of phallocentric boy's club?

		Adam: Dare I?
		Poison: You do if you're gonna be roomies with me!
		Adam: Okay, then: Who was Morton J. Pricker? 
		Poison: Well, only because you asked... \nIn 1965, Dr. Morton J. Pricker wrote the health curriculum adopted by the ten surrounding counties. 
		Poison: Strict emphasis on abstinence before marriage, refraining from "inducing emissions" for penis-haveers (and no mention of the possibility of anyone else doing the same kind of thing) 
		Poison: ...and multiple references to the importance of cultivating healthy same-sex friendships while also absolutely coming down on "uhealthy friendships" -- but never once saying exactly what those might look like.
		Adam: Oh dear.
		Poison: Some of the older teachers still quote him with a straight face.
		Adam: They must have loved you.
		Poison: They mostly did, actually. I was a pretty good kid. They never once called me by the right name or pronoun, but they thought I was the best little... well. You get the idea.
		Adam: Yeah. Sorry.
		Poison: Hey. I'm here now. I got out. That's all that matters.

		Poison: Well, you get two queer autistic kids each with a love of things most people think are creepy, and there's good odds they'll both end up here.
		Adam: I... guess I can see that.
		Poison: Have you not met anyone? It's the neurodivergent alphabet mafia around here. 
		Adam: I hadn't noticed, I guess I'll have to look closer.

- It's actually fascinating.

- Lichens, not moss

Poison: [#wistful] So there was this one time, I must have been maybe twelve? 
Poison: We were sitting on his porch swing, drinking these gas station root beers he always bought me.
Poison: [#smile] And out of nowhere, completely serious, he goes: "If you ever find yourself on a roof with a goat and a weathervane, bet on the goat."
- What does that even mean?
	Poison: [#laughing] I have no idea! That was Pee-Paw for you. Absolute nonsense delivered like ancient wisdom.
	Poison: But you know what? Years later I was helping a friend catch their escaped goat off their garage roof...
	Poison: ...and that ridiculous advice was all I could think about.
- Sounds like he had a unique perspective
	Poison: [#fond] That's one way to put it. He was full of these weird one-liners.
	Poison: But there was usually something to them, even if it wasn't obvious right away.
- Did you ever ask him what he meant?
	Poison: [#shaking_head] Nah. That wasn't really how we worked. He'd say something wild, I'd roll my eyes, and years later it would somehow make sense.
	Poison: [#laughing] Or at least I'd convince myself it did.
Poison: [#grateful] Thanks for listening to my random Pee-Paw story. Not many people I share that stuff with.
