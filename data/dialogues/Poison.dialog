Poison: Hey Adam. What's up?
- How are you doing today?
	Poison: About as good as a radish that's been left in the sun. Take that however you want.
	Adam: (I'm not sure if that's good or bad...)
	=> main_topics
- Can I ask you something?
	=> main_topics
- Nothing, just saying hi.
	Poison: [shrugs] Well, mission accomplished I guess.

- What are you working on?
	Poison: Just trying to finish this lichen classification for Moss's class. The man loves his fungi a little too much, if you ask me.
	Adam: He certainly is passionate about them.
	Poison: That's one word for it. [smiles slightly]

~ ask_about_necklace
Poison: [touches the small metal vial] Oh, this? [laughs awkwardly]
Poison: It's... um, it holds some of my Pee-Paw's ashes.
Adam: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Poison: No, it's cool. It's a way of keeping family close, even now. Not everyone gets it, but it works for me.

~ peepaw_conversation
Poison: Pee-Paw? [softens] He was something else. Raised me mostly, after mom got sick.
Poison: He had this old house with a massive porch swing where we'd sit for hours. He'd tell the weirdest stories...
Adam: He sounds like he was important to you.
Poison: Yeah. [quiet for a moment] He was. Still is, I guess. That's why I carry this. [touches necklace]

Poison: [listening to Dusty talk about their grandmother, then turns to you quietly]
Poison: Hey... remind me later. I got a story about Pee-Paw. Might make you laugh.

~ grandpa_goat_story
Poison: [laughs] Okay, so we're sitting on the porch swing one day drinking these gas station root beers...
Poison: And out of nowhere, Pee-Paw turns to me, all serious, and says:
Poison: "If you ever find yourself on a roof with a goat and a weathervane, bet on the goat."
Adam: ...What does that even mean?
Poison: [shrugs, smiling] No idea! That was Pee-Paw. Full of weird wisdom that made no sense until exactly when you needed it.
Poison: I've been waiting for my roof-goat-weathervane moment ever since. [touches necklace fondly]
Adam: That's... actually pretty amazing.
Poison: [looks genuinely pleased] Yeah. It is.

~ dusty_history_hint
Poison: [glances around] Dusty? It's... complicated. 
Poison: Let's just say we both dated the same terrible person in high school.
Poison: It could have gone really badly, but... [shrugs]
Poison: Ancient history now.

~ dusty_history_full
Poison: [sighs] Fine, since you're so curious.
Poison: This person - I won't even say their name - they were manipulative. Played us against each other.
Poison: Dusty and I hated each other for months because of all the lies we were being told.
Adam: What happened?
Poison: On the last day of high school, we both confronted them at the same time. Total accident.
Poison: [smiles slightly] Turned out we had more in common than we thought. We ditched them right there and went to get milkshakes.
Poison: Been friends ever since. Kind of weird, but good weird.
