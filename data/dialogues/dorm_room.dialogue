~ cat_bed
A small, well-loved cat bed sits tucked by the window. A few strands of black fur cling to the faded fabric.

~ crinkle_ball
A lightweight crinkle ball toy lies abandoned near the desk. When you nudge it with your toe, it lets out a satisfyingly crunchy sound.

~ felt_mouse
A battered felt mouse toy, one ear missing. Clearly a veteran of many battles.

~ scratching_post
A frayed scratching post leans against the bunk bed. Deep claw marks cover it from top to bottom.

~ loose_cricket
A quick flicker of movement catches your eye — a cricket darts across the floor and vanishes under the desk.

~ covered_terrarium
A heavy cloth covers a large tank. You catch the faintest sound of skittering from underneath, but think better of lifting it.

~ empty_insect_box
An empty insect display box labeled "Pending Specimens." Dust gathers inside its neat little compartments.

~ glass_jar
A wide-mouthed glass jar with air holes punched through the lid. It smells faintly like damp moss and old leaves.

~ loose_book
A heavy textbook sags halfway off the wall shelf. Botany diagrams and tiny scribbled notes peek out from the margins.

~ stack_of_notebooks
A neat stack of blank notebooks sits on the corner of the desk, spines crisp and unbroken, waiting for stories.

~ curtains
Heavy green curtains frame the window. You could pull them open to invite in the sun — or close them and keep the world out.
