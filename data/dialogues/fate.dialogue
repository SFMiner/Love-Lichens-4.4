# Dialogue: Fate

~ start
Fate: The breeze feels like it’s carrying secrets today.
- "Like what?" => fate_poetic
- Adam: That charm on your wrist—it Kitty’s? ask_about_charm [if GameState.has_tag("fate_kitty_wrist_seen")]


~ fate_poetic
Fate: Like something old remembering itself forward. You know, standard weather.

~ ask_about_charm
Fate: Mhm. She gave it to me in exchange for three sardines and a piece of my soul.
- "Was it worth it?" => fate_smile

~ fate_smile
Fate: Oh, absolutely. She has the better half of my soul now.


=> END
